## DISCLAIMER

** IMPORTANT:** LiLo is currently in an **ALPHA** state. We are working toward making the application ready for production release. As such, you use the application **at your own risk**.  Many areas of the application may not be available and functionality will be subject to change.  Feedback with improvements and raising of issues from the user base will be highly appreciated and accepted.  Submit any issue or feature request here [Issues](https://github.com/GeorgeLeithead/LiLo_Public/issues).

It is highly recommended that you test the LiLo application and your trading ideas on TestNet/Developer network, before risking real currencies on MainNet.
**You** are responsible for keeping your API key(s) safe. If you suspect that your key(s) have been compromised, it is your responsibility to immediately remove them and generate new keys on the ByBit network.
LiLo depends on services provided by ByBit for operation.  LiLo operates on the provision of these services and operates on a **BEST EFFORTS** basis.

## ByBit integration
The LiLo application integrates with the ByBit service.  The LiLo application does not require that you obtain API key(s) from ByBit to operate, but in order to place orders (single or ladder), you need API key(s) on the appropriate network.
It is highly recommended that you test the LiLo application and your trading ideas on TestNet/Developer network, before risking real currencies on MainNet.
