## DISCLAIMER

** IMPORTANT:** LiLo is currently in an **ALPHA** state. We are working toward making the application ready for production release. As such, you use the application **at your own risk**.  Many areas of the application may not be available, and functionality will be subject to change.

It is highly recommended that you test the LiLo application and your trading ideas on TestNet/Developer network, before risking real currencies on MainNet.
**You** are responsible for keeping your API key(s) safe. If you suspect that your key(s) have been compromised, it is your responsibility to immediately remove them and generate new keys on the ByBit network.
LiLo depends on services provided by ByBit for operation.  LiLo operates on the provision of these services and operates on a **BEST EFFORTS** basis.

## ByBit integration
The LiLo application integrates with the ByBit service.  The LiLo application does not require that you obtain API key(s) from ByBit to operate, but to place orders (single or ladder), you need API key(s) on the appropriate network.
It is highly recommended that you test the LiLo application and your trading ideas on TestNet/Developer network, before risking real currencies on MainNet.

All the exchange services provided by ByBit can be found on [ByBit.com](https://www.bybit.com/).  Please give them your support, and if there are any issues not specifically related to LiLo, please engage them directly.
