# LiLo (Public) 
Public repository for the LiLo (Ladder In Ladder Out) Mobile Application.

## Overview
The purpose of LiLo is to provide an alternative to the ByBit mobile and Web applications, and to add additional features that they do not (currently) provide.  One of the main features we aim to provide is the ability to automate the casting of order ladders.

## Supported Platforms: Android, iOS and Windows

The LiLo app is currently available for these platforms:

Therefore, you use the application **at your own risk***.  Many areas of the application may not be available and functionality will be subject to change.  Feedback with improvements and raising of issues from the user base will be highly appreciated and accepted.
It is highly recommended that you test the LiLo application and your trading ideas on TestNet/Developer network, before risking real currencies on MainNet.

LiLo depends on services provided by ByBit for operation.  LiLo operates on the provision of these services and operates on a **BEST EFFORTS** basis.

## ByBit integration
The LiLo application integrates with the ByBit service.  The LiLo application does not require that you obtain API key(s) from ByBit to operate, but in order to place orders (single or ladder), you need API key(s) on the appropriate network.
